# Words count

Write a program that given a folder, opens all the text files in that folder and counts each word.

Then print out the top 20 words.

```sh
$ ./count example/
to
of
the
â€¦
```

Provided is a test case:

```sh
example/wikipedia.txt
example/wikipedia.out
```

The `txt` file is an abstract from wikipedia, while the `out` file is the expected output.

## Bonus

Allow the extra flag `-ngram X` where the user can specify how many n-gram to use to count, instead of single words.
